With increasing commercial involvement in space and heightened international commitments to responsible space practices, the year saw a range of key developments aimed at ensuring the long-term viability and sustainability of space operations.\n\n## 1. Addressing Space Debris and Traffic Management\n\nSpace debris and traffic management emerged as critical challenges in 2024. With the expected tripling of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) over the next six years, the risk of collisions and the creation of more debris has raised serious concerns for the sustainability of space operations.\n\nIn response, the space industry has prioritised active debris removal and collision avoidance systems. Astroscale’s ADRAS-J mission made notable progress in space debris management, demonstrating the potential of rendezvous technology by approaching space debris. Though the mission was halted due to an anomaly, it marked a significant step forward for debris removal.\n\nThe Zero Debris Charter also gained traction, promoting active debris removal and satellite end-of-life management practices. Moreover, space traffic management was a central topic in 2024, with increased calls for the development of global Space Situational Awareness (SSA) systems. The need for international cooperation to track and monitor space objects is more pressing than ever to ensure the safety of satellites, human spaceflight platforms, and other space-based services.\n\n## 2. In-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (IOSM)\n\nA key development in 2024 was the emergence of In-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (IOSM) as a major industry focus. The IOSM 2024 Conference, held in Harwell, Oxfordshire, brought together experts from the global IOSM industry to discuss the current and future landscape of in-orbit servicing and manufacturing. The conference highlighted the economic, environmental, and scientific benefits of IOSM technologies, which have the potential to revolutionise satellite servicing, reduce space debris, and enhance the sustainability of space operations.\n\nWith over 50 expert speakers, including representatives from the UK and US space agencies, the event provided critical insights into the role of investment, education, training, sustainability, and regulation in the development of the IOSM industry. The discussions at IOSM 2024 emphasised the importance of innovation and collaboration to maximise the benefits of IOSM, supporting its future growth as a cornerstone of sustainable space infrastructure.\n\nThe success of the inaugural IOSM event in 2024 has set the stage for the UK’s second ISAM Conference in 2025, which will be held at the ICC Belfast. With a significantly expanded programme and increased interest, the 2025 event is expected to reflect the growing importance of IOSM for both UK and international space sectors.\n\n## 3. The Space Industry’s Role in Sustainability\n\n2024 also saw a notable shift in the space industry’s commitment to sustainability, driven by the increasing involvement of the private sector. The Space Industry Statement in Support of International Commitments Not to Conduct Destructive Anti-Satellite (DA-ASAT) Testing garnered strong support from space operators, satellite providers, and space-derived service users. As of October 2023, 37 countries, including all EU member states, pledged not to conduct destructive DA-ASAT missile tests, in line with the UN General Assembly’s resolution passed in December 2022.\n\nThis commitment, coupled with ongoing industry efforts to avoid the intentional creation of space debris and safely de-orbit satellites at the end of their operational life, exemplifies the commercial space sector’s growing responsibility in protecting the space environment. The space industry’s active role in space debris mitigation, collision avoidance, and end-of-life satellite management aligns with broader efforts to establish space as a sustainable, shared resource.\n\n## 4. Advancements in Sustainable Space Technologies\n\nThe push for sustainability in space also spurred technological innovations aimed at reducing the environmental impact of space operations. One of the most notable innovations of 2024 was LignoSat, the world’s first wood-panelled satellite, developed by Japanese researchers. Constructed from sustainable magnolia wood, LignoSat weighs just 900g and is a pioneering step towards using renewable materials in space exploration. Its success could pave the way for sustainable construction materials for future lunar and Martian habitats.\n\nMoreover, the Destination Earth (DestinE) initiative continued to advance, with the goal of creating a digital twin of Earth by 2030. The integration of AI, supercomputing, and satellite data will enhance climate modelling, resource management, and disaster prediction, supporting global sustainability and climate action efforts.\n\n## 5. Global Collaboration for Space Sustainability\n\nInternational collaboration remained central to the space sector’s sustainability efforts in 2024. The ITU Space Sustainability Forum, held in Geneva, gathered over 2,000 participants, discussing key issues such as space debris, space traffic management, and the efficient use of orbital resources. The forum highlighted the need for global cooperation, particularly in developing common regulatory frameworks, sharing data on space traffic, and supporting capacity-building for new entrants in the space sector.\n\nThe forum also emphasised the importance of partnerships between space agencies, the private sector, and international organisations to address the pressing challenges of space sustainability. Discussions included the need for transparency, monitoring systems, and regulations to prevent the deliberate creation of long-lived debris, which poses a threat to future space operations.\n\n## 6. The Future of Lunar Exploration and Sustainability\n\nAs lunar exploration picks up pace, the need for sustainable practices extends beyond Earth’s orbit. With multiple nations planning missions to the Moon, discussions in 2024 increasingly focused on ensuring sustainability in lunar operations. This includes developing precise landing technologies and creating shared frameworks for information exchange to avoid interference on the lunar surface.\n\nSustainability on the Moon will require careful management of lunar resources, preventing contamination, and coordinating exploration efforts internationally. These discussions are crucial to ensuring that lunar exploration benefits all of humanity without compromising the space environment.\n\n## Looking Ahead: A Sustainable Future for Space\n\nThe developments in 2024 demonstrate a growing consensus within the space sector about the importance of sustainability. From advancements in in-orbit servicing, space debris management, and technological innovations to international agreements on responsible space practices, the space industry is making significant strides toward ensuring that space remains a sustainable resource.\n\nAs the space sector continues to expand, these efforts will be critical to ensuring the safe, peaceful, and responsible use of space. Through international collaboration, technological innovation, and industry leadership, the space community is poised to tackle the challenges of the coming decades, ensuring that space remains a shared and sustainable domain for future generations.","src/content/blog/2024-in-review.md","043583503e79ca39",{"html":41,"metadata":42},"\u003Cp>The year 2024 marked a significant period of transformation for the space sector, driven by innovative technologies, global collaborations, and a concerted focus on sustainability.

Over three days, scientists, policymakers, data providers, and technology leaders came together to explore how satellite-derived climate information can be more effectively integrated into decision-making and service design.\n\n\n### **Bridging the Gap Between Space Data and Climate Action**\n\nThe symposium’s focus on *co-creation* resonated strongly with us at **Green Orbit Digital**. Our work often sits at the intersection of **space, sustainability, and communication**, helping organisations translate complex climate and environmental data into narratives that inform, inspire, and mobilise action.\n\nAcross sessions, a recurring theme was the importance of connecting the technical capabilities of Europe’s Earth observation infrastructure with the societal needs it serves. Whether through the **Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)**, the **EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facilities (SAFs)**, or national climate centres, the challenge is no longer just about generating data—it’s about making it meaningful.\n\nKey discussions throughout the symposium explored how to:\n\n- Align satellite-based data with evolving **climate policy frameworks** in Europe and globally.\n- Strengthen collaboration between **research institutions, operational services, and industry**.\n- Harness emerging technologies such as **AI, machine learning, and cloud computing** to improve data accessibility.\n- Quantify and communicate the **socio-economic value** of climate information to decision-makers and the public.\n\nThese themes directly mirror the work we champion at Green Orbit Digital—helping partners in the space and sustainability sectors design **data-driven narratives** that build trust, demonstrate impact, and accelerate the uptake of environmental innovation.\n\n\n### **Co-Creation in Practice: The Break-Out Sessions**\n\nOne of the most dynamic aspects of the symposium was the series of **Break-Out Sessions** on 29 October, where participants collaborated on practical approaches to real-world challenges. Each session was led by an operational or research institution, creating space for open dialogue between scientists, service providers, and users.\n\nTopics ranged from **solar energy forecasting** and **drought monitoring** to **marine applications**, **hydrological modelling**, and **heat management** in urban areas. Others addressed how to better **bridge data and demand**, ensuring that climate services meet the needs of different user groups—from policymakers to local planners and businesses.\n\nA recurring insight across the discussions was that **user engagement must happen from the very beginning**. Data products alone are not enough; their value emerges when they are co-designed with those who depend on them. That idea—turning data into dialogue—is central to how we approach sustainability communication at Green Orbit Digital.\n\n\n### **Exploring the Fair of Opportunities**\n\nRunning throughout the symposium was the **Fair of Opportunities**, an open exhibition showcasing Europe’s rich ecosystem of climate data services. Organised into thematic “islands”, it brought together contributors from across the **EUMETSAT SAF network**, the **Copernicus services**, and leading research institutions.\n\nExhibitors demonstrated how satellite-based data supports applications in **solar energy, drought management, marine and heat monitoring, and global climate observation**—each essential to Europe’s path toward climate resilience.\n\nFor us, the Fair was a tangible reminder that the communication of these capabilities is as vital as the technologies themselves. In many ways, the most powerful form of innovation happens not only in laboratories and control rooms, but in how these advancements are **shared, contextualised, and understood** by those shaping the future of our planet.\n\n\n### **From Data to Dialogue**\n\nThroughout the symposium, one message was clear: the future of climate services depends on collaboration—not only between research and operations, but also across sectors and disciplines. The integration of AI and cloud computing will open new possibilities for processing and visualising satellite data, but technology alone won’t drive impact. That comes from **co-creation**, **accessibility**, and **effective storytelling**.\n\nAt Green Orbit Digital, this aligns directly with our mission. We work with organisations across the space and environmental sectors to make **complex climate intelligence accessible**, designing communication strategies and digital platforms that help translate data into understanding and understanding into action.\n\nThe conversations in Darmstadt reaffirmed the value of this work. As EUMETSAT and its partners look toward the next generation of Earth observation systems, it is clear that data literacy, design thinking, and strategic communication will play a pivotal role in ensuring these systems deliver their full societal benefit.\n\n\n### **Looking Forward**\n\nThe symposium closed with a celebration of **25 years of Climate@EUMETSAT**—a testament to Europe’s sustained commitment to using space-based observation for the common good. It also served as a forward-looking reflection on how the next 25 years will require even greater integration between science, technology, and communication.\n\nFor Green Orbit Digital, participation in this milestone event was both an opportunity to engage with the European climate data community and a reminder of the responsibility we share—to ensure that the insights captured from space are translated into impact on Earth.\n\nThe conversations sparked in Darmstadt will continue to inform how we approach our work: using digital storytelling, sustainable marketing, and data strategy to help bridge the gap between **observation and action**—from orbit to outcome.","src/content/news/eumetsat-climate-symposium.md","b4f0fe8a27f8cabd",{"html":397,"metadata":398},"\u003Cp>In late October, Green Orbit Digital joined delegates from across Europe’s climate and space communities in Darmstadt for the \u003Cstrong>EUMETSAT Climate Symposium 2025\u003C/strong>, held under the theme \u003Cem>“From Space to Climate Service: Co-creation in Action.”\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The event marked \u003Cstrong>25 years of Climate@EUMETSAT\u003C/strong>—a milestone in Europe’s commitment to operational climate monitoring and the use of satellite data to inform policy, drive innovation, and ultimately serve society.

Joining a network of 45 global leaders, we are committed to advancing space sustainability, mitigating the risks of orbital debris, and ensuring long-term safety for space operations. This underscores Green Orbit Digital’s support innovative and responsible solutions to the growing challenges of space sustainability.\n\n## Why Space Sustainability Is Critical\n\nSpace is vital to modern society, supporting global communications, navigation, climate monitoring, and disaster management. However, the orbital environment faces significant risks. The European Space Agency (ESA) estimates over 40,500 large debris objects, 1.1 million fragments between 1 cm and 10 cm, and 130 million smaller fragments currently orbit Earth.\n\nThese fragments, traveling at speeds of 28,000 km/h, pose severe risks to satellites, space missions, and even the International Space Station (ISS). A collision with even a small fragment could result in catastrophic damage. Without proactive measures, the orbital environment may become increasingly congested and hazardous, impacting both current operations and future exploration.\n\nGreen Orbit Digital’s endorsement of SSC’s Version 2.39 Best Practices aligns with the urgent need to tackle these challenges and support the sustainable growth of the space industry.\n\n## SSC’s Best Practices: A Framework for Sustainable Space\n\nThe SSC’s Best Practices are designed to address the complexities of orbital sustainability through clear, actionable guidelines. These principles, aligned with international standards such as the UN COPUOS Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines and ISO 24113, promote responsible operations and collaboration across the space sector.\n\n### Core Principles\n\n1. Preventing Orbital Debris: Encouraging responsible satellite design and mission planning to minimise waste.\n\n1. Post-Mission Disposal: Supporting the timely deorbiting of spacecraft and spent stages.\n\n1. Enhancing Data Sharing: Improving space situational awareness (SSA) by fostering open communication among operators.\n\n1. Sustainable Design: Promoting technologies that enable efficient tracking, collision avoidance, and end-of-life disposal.\n\n1. Eco-Friendly Launch Practices: Advocating for reusable rockets and green propellants to reduce the environmental footprint of launches.\n\nThese guidelines provide a foundation for creating a safer and more sustainable orbital environment.\n\n## Tackling Orbital Debris: Innovative Solutions\n\nInnovative technologies are emerging to address the pressing issue of orbital debris:\n\n- Active Debris Removal (ADR): Companies like Astroscale are pioneering ADR missions, including ELSA-d, which aims to capture and remove non-functional satellites from orbit.\n\n- Passive Deorbit Technologies: Drag sails developed by companies like Vestigo Aerospace accelerate satellite re-entry at the end of their operational lifecycle.\n\n- Advanced Tracking Systems: Organisations such as LeoLabs provide radar-based solutions to monitor and predict debris movements, enabling safer navigation and collision avoidance.\n\nWhile these technologies show great promise, challenges such as high costs, scalability, and the need for international cooperation must be addressed to implement them effectively.\n\n## The Economic Imperative of Space Sustainability\n\nSpace sustainability is not just an environmental concern; it is an economic necessity. Operators now spend millions annually on collision avoidance manoeuvres, which consume valuable satellite resources and shorten mission lifespans. Rising insurance premiums further reflect the growing risks posed by space debris.\n\nIf left unaddressed, the economic burden of space debris could exceed billions of dollars annually, as projected by the Secure World Foundation. Proactive investment in sustainability today will prevent greater costs in the future, preserving the financial viability of space operations.\n\n## Governance and Collaboration: A Unified Approach\n\nVoluntary guidelines like the SSC’s Best Practices provide a strong foundation, but binding international regulations are essential for long-term sustainability. Bodies like the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) must work towards:\n\n- Establishing mandatory compliance with debris mitigation standards like ISO 24113.\n\n- Incentivising sustainable practices through grants, tax breaks, or priority access to orbital slots.\n\n- Implementing penalties for non-compliance to deter irresponsible behaviour.\n\nCollaboration between governments, commercial operators, and civil society will be key to addressing these governance challenges and ensuring equitable access to orbital resources.\n\n## Green Orbit Digital: Empowering Space Sustainability\n\nAt Green Orbit Digital, we recognise that space sustainability is not just about avoiding risk—it is an opportunity to drive innovation, build public trust, and ensure the long-term growth of the space economy. As a sustainability-driven marketing agency, we:\n\n- Raise Awareness: Bridging the gap between technical experts and the public to amplify the importance of sustainable space operations.\n\n- Support Collaboration: Empowering businesses to align with global sustainability goals through actionable strategies.\n\n- Inspire Future Generations: Engaging young professionals to prioritise sustainability in their careers through education and outreach.\n\nBy integrating sustainability into our core operations, we aim to lead by example and inspire collective action across the industry.\n\n## Join the Mission for a Sustainable Orbital Future\n\nGreen Orbit Digital invites spacefaring organisations to endorse the SSC’s Best Practices and contribute to safeguarding the orbital environment. By taking proactive steps now, we can ensure space remains a resource for innovation, exploration, and opportunity.\n\nTo learn more about the SSC’s Best Practices and how to participate, visit SpaceSafety.org or contact info@spacesafety.org.","src/content/news/green-orbit-digital-endorses-space-sustainability.md","287c424821944cd0",{"html":555,"metadata":556},"\u003Cp>Green Orbit Digital is proud endorse the Space Safety Coalition’s (SSC) Best Practices for the Sustainability of Space Operations.

The European Space Agency (ESA) estimates over 40,500 large debris objects, 1.1 million fragments between 1 cm and 10 cm, and 130 million smaller fragments currently orbit Earth.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These fragments, traveling at speeds of 28,000 km/h, pose severe risks to satellites, space missions, and even the International Space Station (ISS). A collision with even a small fragment could result in catastrophic damage. Without proactive measures, the orbital environment may become increasingly congested and hazardous, impacting both current operations and future exploration.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Green Orbit Digital’s endorsement of SSC’s Version 2.39 Best Practices aligns with the urgent need to tackle these challenges and support the sustainable growth of the space industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"sscs-best-practices-a-framework-for-sustainable-space\">SSC’s Best Practices: A Framework for Sustainable Space\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The SSC’s Best Practices are designed to address the complexities of orbital sustainability through clear, actionable guidelines.

Beyond operational improvements, these actions inform **our client advisory work**, allowing us to guide SMEs on practical sustainability measures that are credible, measurable, and communicable through marketing channels.\n\n\n## **Harnessing AI and Digital Tools for Sustainability**\n\nThe **2nd October session** explored the role of **AI and digital technologies** in achieving sustainability goals. From energy monitoring systems to AI-driven logistics optimisation, digital tools can deliver efficiency gains while reducing environmental impact.\n\nFor Green Orbit, the session provided actionable insights into **how technology intersects with marketing and communications**. Using AI and analytics, we can track and showcase sustainability progress for clients, identify opportunities to reduce resource use, and support campaigns that demonstrate **genuine impact rather than superficial claims**. This capability strengthens both operational performance and brand narrative.\n\n\n## **Marketing Green: Communicating Sustainability Authentically**\n\nOn **9th October**, the focus shifted to **marketing sustainability effectively**. Consumers today expect transparency and authenticity, and poorly communicated sustainability efforts risk reputational damage. The session emphasised **storytelling, clear messaging, and aligning brand values with actionable commitments**.\n\nThis aligns seamlessly with Green Orbit’s mission. We help clients articulate their sustainability journey in ways that are **credible, compelling, and measurable**. Whether highlighting low-carbon initiatives, community engagement, or innovative eco-solutions, communicating authentically allows businesses to **attract ethically conscious customers, strengthen stakeholder trust, and differentiate in competitive markets**.\n\n\n## **Financing Sustainable Growth**\n\nThe **16th October session** provided SMEs with insights into **financial tools for sustainability**, including grants, loans, and green finance mechanisms. Understanding how to access funding is essential to scale initiatives beyond small pilot projects.\n\nGreen Orbit now integrates this perspective into our advisory services, helping clients **identify financing opportunities for sustainable projects** and develop communications that appeal to investors, partners, and customers. Sustainability becomes not only a moral imperative but a **business opportunity backed by financial planning**.\n\n\n## **Planning for Long-Term Impact**\n\nThe final session on **23rd October** addressed **sustaining gains over time**. Participants learned how to track progress, maintain momentum, and remain connected with sustainability networks and support systems.\n\nFor Green Orbit, long-term planning is central to our approach. By combining strategic planning, ongoing measurement, and responsible communications, we help clients ensure their sustainability initiatives are **durable, measurable, and aligned with brand purpose**. Whether tracking carbon reductions, reporting on ethical sourcing, or documenting community engagement, consistent communication strengthens both impact and credibility.\n\n\n## **Green Orbit’s Key Takeaways**\n\nParticipation in the Green Growth Programme has reinforced several principles that underpin our work at Green Orbit Digital:\n\n- Sustainability initiatives **deliver tangible business value** when strategically planned and executed.\n- Responsible communications are **essential for credibility, customer engagement, and brand differentiation**.\n- Accessing funding and leveraging technology amplifies sustainability efforts and ensures **scalability**.\n- Long-term impact relies on **measurement, reporting, and continuous improvement**, supported by robust marketing strategies.\n\n> “Sustainability is only as powerful as the story you tell about it. At Green Orbit, we help organisations act responsibly, communicate responsibly, and grow responsibly.” – Ryan Laird, Director\n> \n\n\n## **Take Action: Build Your Sustainable Growth Strategy**\n\nThe 2025 Green Growth Programme has now reached full capacity, but SMEs can **sign up to be the first to hear about the next round**.

Drawing on evidence from the \u003Cstrong>Willow Review\u003C/strong>, participants examined how sustainability initiatives can translate into \u003Cstrong>tangible business benefits\u003C/strong>: reducing costs through energy efficiency, enhancing resilience against supply chain shocks, and strengthening competitive positioning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For Green Orbit, this session underscored a critical lesson: \u003Cstrong>sustainability is not just about environmental stewardship—it is a strategic lever for growth\u003C/strong>. We reflected on how clients in the space sector, for example, can integrate sustainable practices into satellite manufacturing, launch planning, and operational protocols, and how these actions, when communicated clearly, enhance both credibility and stakeholder confidence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“Sustainability isn’t just about doing good—it’s about doing well.

This partnership reflects a shared commitment to shaping resilient, inclusive, and climate-conscious urban environments as the world’s cities confront rapid growth, environmental pressures, and shifting social needs.\n\nThe term ‘Smart City’ has become increasingly prominent—especially in the post-pandemic era—as societies push for greener, more efficient, and digitally connected urban living. But what exactly makes a city ‘smart’? Smart cities are grounded in a framework of information and communication technologies (ICT), enabling sustainable practices and smarter resource management to meet the mounting challenges of urbanisation.\n\n> \n“By 2050, an estimated 70% of the global population will reside in cities. This mass migration underscores the urgency of building cities that are not only livable and efficient but also environmentally responsible,” said Ryan Laird, Director at Green Orbit Digital. “We’re thrilled to join the SmartCitiesWorld community to help amplify these crucial efforts through sustainable marketing, digital innovation, and space-enabled solutions.”\n\n\nSmart cities operate on the premise of maximising available resources and improving services, quality of life, and infrastructure through data-driven technologies. Whether through public transport, water systems, energy management, or digital access to services, the overarching goals remain consistent: reduce waste, enhance performance, empower citizens, and create healthier urban ecosystems.\n\nSmartCitiesWorld, with over 52,000 global members representing more than 3,000 cities, offers a collaborative platform that addresses these themes through five key content pillars:\n\n- Connectivity & Data\n\n- Governance & Citizen\n\n- Energy & Environment\n\n- Mobility\n\n- Urban Space\n\nAs part of the collaboration, Green Orbit Digital will contribute thought leadership articles, co-develop city profiles, and spotlight innovations at the intersection of sustainability, marketing, and digital transformation. Their expertise in leveraging space-based insights—such as satellite data for environmental monitoring—aligns with SmartCitiesWorld’s mission to foster smarter, net-zero cities.\n\nExamples of smart initiatives around the globe abound. In Dubai, the world’s longest driverless metro enhances sustainable mobility. Seoul’s government plans to roll out 270,000 electric vehicles by 2050. In Europe, cities like Edinburgh commit to localised food systems to tackle the climate emergency, while others embrace the 15-minute city model, championed by C40 and Arup, to build low-carbon, community-oriented neighbourhoods.\n\nArtificial intelligence and IoT sensors are also transforming urban systems—from detecting traffic patterns to optimising energy grids and improving air quality. As cities generate oceans of data, the ability to extract value and engage citizens in the process is becoming a defining feature of truly smart urban planning.\n\nGreen Orbit Digital’s participation in SmartCitiesWorld underscores its growing role in supporting city leaders, public institutions, and businesses with sustainable strategy, stakeholder engagement, and climate communications. Their approach helps clients navigate complex transitions, unlock innovation ecosystems, and tell compelling stories of change.\n\nIn the words of a SmartCitiesWorld open letter: “At COP26, while nations pledge, it will be cities that must deliver.”\n\nAbout SmartCitiesWorldSmartCitiesWorld is a world-leading platform for sharing ideas to solve urban challenges, helping cities become more resilient, inclusive, and prosperous.

But what exactly makes a city ‘smart’? Smart cities are grounded in a framework of information and communication technologies (ICT), enabling sustainable practices and smarter resource management to meet the mounting challenges of urbanisation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>“By 2050, an estimated 70% of the global population will reside in cities. This mass migration underscores the urgency of building cities that are not only livable and efficient but also environmentally responsible,” said Ryan Laird, Director at Green Orbit Digital. “We’re thrilled to join the SmartCitiesWorld community to help amplify these crucial efforts through sustainable marketing, digital innovation, and space-enabled solutions.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Smart cities operate on the premise of maximising available resources and improving services, quality of life, and infrastructure through data-driven technologies. Whether through public transport, water systems, energy management, or digital access to services, the overarching goals remain consistent: reduce waste, enhance performance, empower citizens, and create healthier urban ecosystems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>SmartCitiesWorld, with over 52,000 global members representing more than 3,000 cities, offers a collaborative platform that addresses these themes through five key content pillars:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Connectivity &#x26; Data\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Governance &#x26; Citizen\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Energy &#x26; Environment\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Mobility\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Urban Space\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>As part of the collaboration, Green Orbit Digital will contribute thought leadership articles, co-develop city profiles, and spotlight innovations at the intersection of sustainability, marketing, and digital transformation.

Our mission is to propel space-related businesses toward eco-conscious practices and inspire a brighter, more sustainable future. \n\nThe space industry, with its remarkable potential for discovery and innovation, now stands at a crossroads. As we see unprecedented growth in the sector, there is a critical need for responsible stewardship. There is an emerging realisation that our growing access to space must align with sustainable principles, safeguarding not only our earthly home but beyond as we reach out beyond our planet. In this defining moment, Green Orbit Digital emerges as the catalyst, the change-maker, and the visionary that the space industry has been waiting for.\n\n## A Sustainable Approach to Reach for the Stars\n\nIn recent years, we’ve seen the rise of sustainability as an imperative force, reshaping industries worldwide. Sustainability is not just a buzzword but a call to action, an ethos that has revolutionised how businesses operate. The space industry is no exception. While the allure of the cosmos beckons us forward, we recognise that our presence in space must echo our commitment to preserving our fragile planet. At Green Orbit Digital, we’ve accepted the challenge and present the space industry with a compelling case – a business case for sustainability.\n\nOur journey begins with a fundamental premise: the future of space exploration should be awe-inspiring and environmentally responsible. In an age where corporate social responsibility is paramount, space-related businesses must embrace sustainability at their core. Why? It’s not only because a greener approach is morally essential but also because it’s strategically astute. The global community is now looking to the stars with hopeful eyes, desiring not only scientific achievements but also eco-conscious practices. By incorporating sustainability into their marketing, space companies can unlock numerous benefits:\n\n1. Enhanced Reputation and Trust: Sustainability resonates with the values of the masses. Embracing eco-conscious practices not only builds trust with your audience but also empowers them to be advocates of your mission.\n\n2. Competitive Edge: Space is no longer just the playground of governments. Private companies are rapidly expanding into the industry. By leading with sustainable marketing, you distinguish yourself from the competition and capture a niche market.\n\n3. Strategic Alliances: Green initiatives often lead to the formation of invaluable partnerships and collaborations. By promoting sustainability, you can build relationships with like-minded organisations and governments.\n\n4. Regulatory Compliance: As space governance evolves, environmentally responsible practices may become mandatory. By adopting sustainability early, you position yourself ahead of potential regulations.\n\n5. Ethical Impact: Beyond profit, the space industry is about the greater good, and a sustainable approach embodies this ethos, inspiring stakeholders and driving positive change.\n\nAt Green Orbit Digital, we have harnessed the power of sustainable marketing. We understand that it’s not just about doing the right thing; it’s also about doing the smart thing for your business. Our expertise, honed in the realms of marketing and sustainability, enables us to guide space-related businesses toward a greener future.\n\nJoin us on this extraordinary journey to rewrite the rules of space marketing. Together, we can propel the industry forward, achieving new heights while preserving the planet and fulfilling our duty to future generations.

Credit: Space Renaissance International.\n\nGreen Orbit Digital is proud to announce its participation in the Space 18th SDG Coalition’s second annual workshop, taking place on 19 September 2024 at the United Nations Plaza in New York and online. As one of 94 space-stakeholder organisations united under this coalition, we are thrilled to contribute to global discussions on the critical role of space in building a sustainable and peaceful future.\n\nThe hybrid event, which marks the lead-up to World Space Week, will gather industry leaders, space development experts, and policy influencers to address the significance of civilian-led space initiatives in advancing sustainable development goals. A key focus of this year’s workshop is the proposed 18th SDG, dedicated to sustainable space development, a theme closely aligned with Green Orbit Digital’s mission to promote eco-conscious ventures in the space sector.\n\n## Green Orbit Digital at the Forefront of Space Sustainability\n\nRyan Laird, Director of Green Orbit Digital, will speak as part of the prestigious “Space Symposium for the Future” session, moderated by Adriano V. Autino, Founder of Space Renaissance International (SRI). Ryan’s talk, titled “Engaging Stakeholders in Sustainable Space Development for a Resilient Future,” will delve into strategies for fostering robust stakeholder engagement aligned with both the U.N. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Space 2030 Agenda.\n\nRyan will explore the unique challenges and opportunities of involving diverse actors—governments, private enterprises, NGOs, and the general public—in the narrative of space as a frontier for sustainable economic and social growth. His presentation will highlight best practices in sustainable marketing, focusing on crafting compelling narratives that resonate across different sectors and cultures. Emphasising transparency, inclusivity, and ethical considerations, Ryan will discuss how these elements build trust and secure long-term commitment from stakeholders.\n\nThe talk will also address the role of education and awareness in bridging knowledge gaps, fostering a sense of shared purpose, and promoting the idea of space development as a key driver of global sustainability. By effectively engaging stakeholders, we can ensure that the expansion into the cislunar economy and beyond is not only technologically and economically viable but also socially and environmentally sustainable.\n\n## Key Sessions and Highlights\n\nThe workshop will feature two core sessions:\n\n1. Space Symposium for the Future (9:00 AM US EDT): Bringing together keynote speakers from organisations such as The Mars Society, the Human Space Program, and the Lifeboat Foundation, the session will explore the potential of space development in driving global progress.\n\n1. Space Workshop for the Future (2:30 PM US EDT): Facilitated by Robert S. Katz of the World Innovation Network (WIN), this interactive segment will feature five focused tracks covering key areas such as the Space 2030 Agenda, Space for Peace, Economic and Social Growth, Young Generations in Space, and Earth’s Sustainability.\n\n## Looking Ahead: The Space for the Future Report\n\nThe outcomes of this event will feed into the final Space for the Future report, set to be released on 10 October 2024. The report will provide actionable recommendations to inform the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Space 2030 Agenda, addressing the need for coordinated efforts to integrate space technology into sustainable development frameworks.\n\nGreen Orbit Digital is excited to engage in these vital conversations, furthering our mission of embedding sustainability into the heart of space ventures. We invite all stakeholders to join us in-person or virtually, as we work towards a future where space development serves as a pillar of sustainability and peace for our planet and beyond.\n\nEvent Details:\n\n- Date: 19 September 2024\n\n- Time: 9:00 AM – 6:30 PM (US EDT)/2:00 PM – 11:30 PM (BST)/3:00 PM  – 00:30 AM (CEST)\n\n- Location: 777 United Nations Plaza, New York, NY 10017\n\n- To attend in person: Registration Link\n\n- To follow the live stream: YouTube Live\n\nWe look forward to collaborating with global leaders and space enthusiasts to shape a sustainable future for space exploration and development.","src/content/news/green-orbit-space-18th-sdg-un-workshop.md","e25d4171a45bc46a",{"html":988,"metadata":989},"\u003Cp>A Space 18th SDG for the Future, a Hybrid Workshop.

Our involvement underscores our dedication to leveraging technology and creativity to address critical environmental challenges. This year, we bring forward the idea of Ocean Explorer—a unique fusion of cutting-edge digital tools and sustainability-focused education.\n\n## Embracing Innovation and Sustainability\n\nAt Green Orbit Digital, we believe that effective marketing goes beyond promoting products; it entails championing causes that matter. Our participation in #OceanHack4EU aligns perfectly with our mission to foster a sustainable future through innovative digital solutions. Ocean Explorer epitomises this mission, aiming to bridge the gap between oceanic science and public awareness.\n\n## The Importance of the Ocean\n\nWe all know the ocean’s central role in our lives and how much humanity depends on its good health. However, we are still learning about it: 95% of it is still unexplored, and new organisms are regularly being discovered. The oceans are not just vast bodies of water but crucial ecosystems supporting life on our planet. The ocean provides food and is a climate regulator, absorbing 25% of our CO2 emissions and 90% of surplus heat from global warming. While the ocean plays a crucial role in the lives of many communities and offers numerous opportunities, it faces threats from climate change and increasing pressures stemming from human activities. These factors affect the health and resilience of marine environments and biodiversity.\n\n## Ocean Explorer: A Vision for the Future\n\nIt’s time to act. That’s why we’re joining #OceanHack4EU, a hackathon to find data-driven solutions to these challenges. Join us as we dive deep into innovation and emerge with prototypes that can make a real difference. Let’s protect our oceans and unlock their potential together. The #OceanHack4EU online hackathon is organised by Mercator Ocean International, an implementer of the EU Copernicus Marine Service, on behalf of the European Commission and carried out by Garage48. During this #OceanHack4EU, the participants are invited to use data and information from the EU’s Copernicus Marine Service to tackle the challenge they want. Other EU marine data providers EMODnet and EUMETSAT, data partners of the event, will support the teams.\n\nThis event echoes Mercator Ocean International’s mission towards global ocean knowledge for a sustainable ocean aligned with the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development vision. It also reflects the aim of the EU Mission “Restore our Ocean and waters” to protect and restore the health of our ocean and waters through research and innovation, citizen engagement, and blue investments.\n\nOcean Explorer is designed to inspire a deeper connection with the ocean and promote marine conservation through interactive and engaging educational resources. By harnessing the power of Copernicus Marine Service data, our project provides real-time insights into ocean health, climate impacts, and marine biodiversity.\n\n## Key Features of Ocean Explorer:\n\n1. Interactive Educational Apps: These apps offer virtual tours of marine ecosystems, allowing users to explore the wonders of the ocean from their devices. Interactive maps and simulations bring oceanographic data to life, making learning both fun and informative.\n\n1. Outreach Programmes: Tailored community programmes utilise Copernicus data to highlight the importance of ocean conservation. Workshops and seminars aim to educate and inspire communities to take action.\n\n1. Interactive Learning Materials: We develop multimedia resources, hands-on activities, and online tools that explain critical oceanic processes like acidification, coral bleaching, and pollution. These materials are designed to be accessible and engaging for all age groups.\n\n1. Citizen Science Initiatives: Ocean Explorer empowers citizens to contribute to marine research by providing platforms for data collection and analysis. This initiative not only enhances scientific research but also fosters a sense of community and responsibility.\n\n1. Artistic Collaborations: By partnering with artists, we aim to create visually compelling art inspired by ocean data. These artworks serve as powerful tools to raise awareness and evoke emotional connections to marine conservation.\n\n## Merging Marketing Expertise with Environmental Advocacy\n\nOur extensive experience in digital marketing enables us to effectively promote Ocean Explorer and maximise its reach. We employ targeted campaigns, social media strategies, and compelling storytelling to engage diverse audiences and drive home the message of marine conservation. Our goal is to ensure that Ocean Explorer not only educates but also motivates individuals and communities to become active stewards of the ocean.\n\n## Impact and Vision\n\nOcean Explorer has the potential to transform how people perceive and interact with the ocean. By making oceanic data accessible and engaging, we aim to cultivate a generation that values and protects marine environments. Our project’s success will be measured by its ability to inspire behavioural change, enhance community engagement, and support scientific research.\n\n## Join Us on Our Journey\n\nGreen Orbit Digital invites you to join us on this exciting journey. Follow our progress at #OceanHack4EU and witness how Ocean Explorer evolves from an innovative idea to a transformative educational tool. Together, we can make a lasting impact on marine conservation and ensure a sustainable future for our oceans.\n\nStay tuned for updates and follow us on social media for the latest news on Ocean Explorer and our other sustainability initiatives. Let’s create a wave of change together!\n\nSTAY CONNECTED AND INFORMED\n\nNEWSLETTERSubscribe to our newsletter, your compass to navigating the ever-evolving realms of space technology, sustainability, and innovation.

This endorsement represents a firm stand against environmental degradation and an embrace of sustainable practices both within and beyond the company’s digital marketing services.\n\n## Why the Plant Based Treaty?\n\nThe Plant Based Treaty is a bold initiative designed to complement the Paris Agreement by addressing the climate impacts of food systems. It places animal agriculture at the centre of the climate conversation, advocating a global shift toward plant-based diets as a pathway to protect ecosystems, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote food security worldwide. By endorsing the Treaty, Green Orbit Digital joins a growing network of individuals, organisations, and cities advocating for systemic change that prioritises the planet’s health.\n\n> \n“We believe that as an organisation shaping narratives in the space industry, we have an important role to play in promoting sustainability. Endorsing the Plant Based Treaty aligns with our values and demonstrates our commitment to advocating for greener futures—not only in space but here on Earth.” – said Ryan Laird, Director of Green Orbit Digital.\n\n\n## A Plan of Action: Workshops and Events to Promote Plant-Based Principles\n\nGreen Orbit Digital’s endorsement of the Plant Based Treaty is just the beginning. The agency is organising a series of workshops and events designed to educate, inspire, and activate sustainable practices in the space sector. These events will aim to:\n\n- Promote Awareness: Green Orbit Digital will host virtual and in-person webinars, bringing experts to discuss the links between food systems, climate change, and sustainable business. These sessions will also address how plant-based solutions can contribute to global sustainability.\n\n- Educate on Practical Implementation: In collaboration with environmental NGOs, Green Orbit Digital will facilitate workshops to introduce the principles of the Treaty, offering practical insights into shifting organisational practices toward plant-based policies, reducing emissions, and promoting sustainable food systems.\n\n- Integrate Plant-Based Principles into Business Strategy: Specialised sessions will guide companies in the space industry on how they can integrate plant-based principles in their operations, catering options, and employee engagement programmes.\n\n## Core Principles of the Treaty\n\nGreen Orbit Digital’s initiatives will focus on three main principles, mirroring the Treaty’s key demands:\n\n1. Redirect: These efforts will work to eliminate the underlying causes of climate damage by encouraging a transition to plant-based systems. Green Orbit Digital will advocate for plant-based alternatives within their clients’ and partners’ operations and is developing informational campaigns on the environmental benefits of a plant-based approach.\n\n1. Relinquish: This principle calls for halting the expansion of harmful practices like deforestation for animal agriculture. Green Orbit Digital aims to influence public discourse by promoting responsible consumption, production, and urban greening projects. Partnering with cities, they will support green initiatives aimed at increasing green spaces, wildlife corridors, and local plant-based food systems.\n\n1. Restore: This principle seeks active ecological restoration. Green Orbit Digital will sponsor community rewilding and reforestation projects, aligning with Treaty goals of replanting critical ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity, and supporting rewilding efforts in communities. These projects will aim to create green oases in urban areas, as well as offering grants for local communities to establish sustainable food gardens.\n\n## Building a Global Movement in the Space Sector\n\nBy adopting the Plant Based Treaty’s goals and weaving them into its ethos, Green Orbit Digital is taking a leadership role in sustainable transformation within the space industry. This endorsement not only signals a commitment to responsible stewardship but also encourages others within the sector to embrace plant-based solutions as a vital element of the climate solution.\n\nIn the words of Oxford University researcher Joseph Poore, “A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth.” Green Orbit Digital’s endorsement of the Plant Based Treaty reflects this wisdom, showing how organisations can be leaders in reducing climate impacts.\n\nAs Green Orbit Digital embarks on this path, it invites other space industry leaders to join the movement, furthering the cause of a sustainable planet that can thrive alongside human innovation.","src/content/news/plant-based-treaty.md","8b1fcca442bf7417",{"html":1209,"metadata":1210},"\u003Cp>In a landmark commitment to environmental responsibility, Green Orbit Digital has proudly endorsed the Plant Based Treaty, aligning with its mission to drive eco-conscious innovation in the space industry.

By using satellite data, businesses, financial institutions, and environmental organisations can collaborate more effectively, sharing insights and strategies to address nature-related financial risks. Green Orbit Digital is actively working to promote this collaboration within the TNFD Forum, advocating for the wider adoption of space technology in reporting frameworks.\n\n## The Power of Space Data in Enhancing Financial Disclosures\n\nThe potential of space technology to improve the accuracy of financial disclosures is immense. With tools like Earth observation satellites, organisations can gain real-time insights into environmental changes and risks, providing a clearer picture of their impact on natural systems.\n\nBy incorporating space-based data into the TNFD’s recommended framework, Green Orbit Digital is helping to make nature-related financial disclosures more robust, credible, and actionable.

On the other hand, a number of CORS networks operate receivers that are powered by renewable energy sources (e.g., solar panels or wind turbines), so the utilization of GNSS for renewable energy operations brings mutual benefits.\n",[164,33,131,35],"src/content/space-applications/site-selection-planning-and-monitoring.md","127f635e8cdbba4f",{"html":15,"metadata":3567},{"headings":3568,"localImagePaths":3569,"remoteImagePaths":3570,"frontmatter":3571,"imagePaths":3573},[],[],[],{"title":3561,"markets":2647,"description":3562,"domains":15,"copernicus":2073,"EGNSS":2073,"SDGs":3572},[164,33,131,35],[],"site-selection-planning-and-monitoring.md","situational-awareness-supporting-search-and-rescue",{"id":3575,"data":3577,"filePath":3581,"digest":3582,"rendered":3583,"legacyId":3591},{"title":3578,"markets":2185,"description":3579,"domains":15,"copernicus":2073,"EGNSS":2073,"SDGs":3580,"featuredImage":1469},"Situational awareness supporting search and rescue","Earth observation services can assist Maritime and Joint Rescue Coordination Centres in a wide range of activities at sea, including support to search and rescue operations and exercises.
